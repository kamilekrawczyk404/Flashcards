### General info

On one hand the reason why I created this app is my incentive to increase my knowledge in foreign languages. In many apps some features are available only with an annual subscription, which I don't prefer. On other hand I wanted to gain experience in new backend environment which is Laravel - in my opinion a super powerful tool to create simple apps in short time.

### Inspiration
As I've mentioned above, inspiration to create this app was [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/en-gb) which let users a wide range of possibilities to learn languages. In my project I included main layout of their page and three base components (Learn, Test, Match).
